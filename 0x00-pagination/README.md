Pagination in software engineering refers to the practice of dividing a large set of data or content into smaller, manageable chunks called pages. This is commonly done in applications that display lists or tables of information, such as search results, user profiles, or data tables.

The main purpose of pagination is to improve the user experience by presenting only a limited amount of data at a time, making it easier to navigate and reducing the load on the system. Instead of loading and displaying all the data at once, the application displays a subset of the data on each page. Users can then navigate through the pages to access additional information.

Pagination typically involves the use of navigation controls, such as "Next" and "Previous" buttons or page numbers, allowing users to move forward or backward through the data set. Additionally, parameters like the number of items per page are often configurable to accommodate different user preferences.

By implementing pagination, software developers can enhance performance, reduce server load, and provide a more efficient and responsive user interface, particularly when dealing with large datasets.
