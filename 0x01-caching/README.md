Caching is a technique used in computing to temporarily store and manage copies of frequently accessed or recently used data, files, or resources. The purpose of caching is to improve system performance and response time by reducing the need to fetch or compute the same information repeatedly. When a user or application requests data, the system first checks the cache to see if the information is already stored. If found, the data can be quickly retrieved from the cache, saving time compared to fetching it from the original source, such as a database or the internet. Caching is widely used in various computing environments, including web browsers, databases, and operating systems, to optimize resource utilization and enhance overall system efficiency.
